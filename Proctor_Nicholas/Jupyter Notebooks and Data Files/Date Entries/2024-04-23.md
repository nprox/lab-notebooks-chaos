- Due to limitations in either the encoder or REPT functionality graph is digitized to the integer
	- less apparent when angular velocity is high
- Graph y-axis label going off screen
	- Dynamically change y-axis-tick labels font_size on length
	- Reduce C-label's font size to 9 to add space to the right of the figure
- Removing outliers
	- adding mask to data after loading through pd might be the cause
	- original was getting wrong file???
		- w/ mask freq, ampl are matching with filename and filepath
		- w/o mask is now also getting the same
			- why??? -> multiple trials, graph being overwritten
			- Change in naming scheme: **AMPL FREQ Date**
				- Repeats should become visible in file explorer
