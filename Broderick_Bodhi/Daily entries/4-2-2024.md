Today I gave my 3rd presentation and got some very helpful feedback from Dr. Zimmerman. He suggested we 1. use sharpie to label the boards for clarity, 2. try building a partial board on a breadboard, and 3. building new MCO's 

To start, we replaced the incorrect mosfet on the red mco board - now labeled 2 with sharpie, because it was the same as the other one and they are supposed to be different, one for negative and one for positive. 

We tested the capacitors with diode mode, we tested several resistors, and we tested oscillation at several points with oscilloscope.
