Today began with grabbing an ethernet cable from Dr. Zimmerman in order to give internet to the desktop pc that Nick got from the surplus sale. 

We also today want to solder another board together and install it on the other MCO.

I soldered the board together and installed it on the red taped MCO, but we found that unfortunately the smaller magnets are not as strong as the large one and so the coils weren't able to move the rotor.

I think one problem is the magnet strength and another i sthat the copper coils dont have great connection to eachother, because the working mco power supply uses 5 volts at 1 amp on the outer coils but the red mco only uses 1.9 with 1 amp.

Nick worked on code to let us operate the mco through ethernet without needing to be here.
