Back from spring break this week. 

Nick did some great troubleshooting over spring break and theorized that possibly the microcontroller is the cause of our inner coil being stuck on. 

One controller is missing a resistor, another has its microcontroller backwards. We want to replace the microcontroller on the mco controller that was working to see if that fixes it, and we want to flip around the other microcontroller on the backwards board. 

I soldered copper wire to connect ground negative and positive, flipped the direction of a diode, and added a missing resistor to a spare board we had that was partially put together. I did it to match the orientation of the board that we had working at one point. 

Alas, the teensy wasn't showing up on either of our computers COM ports.

Next time, I want to try replacing the microcontroller on the mco that we had working to see if that makes it work again.
