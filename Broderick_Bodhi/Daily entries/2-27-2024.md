No presentations next week, and labs but no after-lab class

Dr Zimmerman suggested we use the raspberry pi's onboard time collection rather than bothering with the teensy so it is more consistent. 

After the 4 439 presentations, we moved the the lab as usual

Nick modified the bounded data Ampl500 100Freq77_bounded so that the position and time values were consistently changing and the graph looked like this after 30 seconds:

As the time span increases, its harder to see the gradations of the position. This trial was run with an amplitude of 500 and a frequency of 1

Nick used code to modify the Ampl500 100Freq77_bounded file to add a third column, angular velocity, that is change in position / change in time.
this is position vs  angular velocity: (for the first 50,000 data points)

Heres a plot of all 19 million data points:

This graph looks pretty similar to the one provide in the research paper here:
![[lab-notebooks-chaos/Proctor_Nicholas/Misc Files/Pasted image 20240227095949.png]]At this point, I expect we will soon start to automate the adjustment of the frequency for a set number of data points per frequency value.
