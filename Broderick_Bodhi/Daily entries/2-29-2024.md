Today, we saw 5 presentations then went to the lab. We don't have 439 class after this class b/c Dr. Zimmerman has a prior engagement. 

In lab, we looked at our latest batch of data with a frequency of 0.79. The data has several outliers as shown below:

I spent some lab time making my table of contents and writing small summaries of each day.

Then Nick worked on the code to fix the concatenation error likely causing the outliers, and meanwhile I experimented with creating a Poincare section of some of our data.

In general I have 3 goals in mind for the MCO: Poincare sections, Liapunov exponents, and bifurcation diagrams.

Im starting with Poincare sections, which im trying to understand the basics of. I believe a poincare section is a 2d graph of the interceptions of a 3d flow over time as shown

I also worked on trying to figure out what the error lights mean on the teensy board. In the process i discovered the REPT command which gives a very quickly updating output of time? position and angular velocity in the console.

Randomly around 10:30am the MCO stopped oscillating, and we started trying to figure out why. We tried using the other MCO but it didn't work, though it had never worked correctly. We also tried using PuTTY instead of python. It didn't work. Hopefully the MCO was just overheated, we'll find out next week.
