Today, we resumed working with the new circuit board I soldered last Thursday. We did some oscilloscope examination and found an interesting phenomenon with the ground and negative shorted wherein the voltage rather than periodically oscillating would go on for about a second off for a second on for a half second, off for a half second, and repeat.

Nick and I decided to place the newly created board on the previously working MCO box. To mount it, I used some longer standoffs so the three banana clip receivers would fit. After setting everything up, it worked! We still have to short ground to positive, but it is back to working like how it was before it broke, which is great news.

Now were back to gathering data, modifying the python code, and working on unattended data collection for longer batches.
