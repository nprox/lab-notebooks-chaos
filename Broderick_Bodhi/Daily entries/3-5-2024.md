Today we returned to the MCO still not activating properly unfortunately. We observed that on both MCO's, both coil pairs are just on with the inner pair not oscillating on and off like it should. The is based on the magnetic dipole being positioned around 45 degrees.

I transferred the teensy code from the pdf to the Arduino IDE and also installed a plugin for the ide to communicate with the teensy which worked correctly. We are able to communicate with the board for the purposes of receiving position and time data as well as angular velocity data which is calculated onboard the teensy. But we still haven't figured out why it is that the inner coil is just stuck on instead of oscillating.

Meanwhile, Nick refactored the code utilizing the REPT command in order to increase our data collection rate.
