Picking up where we left off thursday, we continue to try to get one or both of the MCO's working again. 

I soldered pins on a new teensy and reworked some of the joints on the orange-taped control board. 

Other than that, Nick and I probed the boards with a multimeter in an effort to find where the oscillating electricity was being lost, as well as with an oscilliscope to see if we could gleen anything from the wave pattern of the oscillating signal.

We've discovered that in order to make the MCO oscillate at all, the inner coil's power supply positive lead needs to be shorted to ground.
