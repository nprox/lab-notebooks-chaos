Today we continued probing the control board, trying to figure out why the mosfets aren't providing their power to the inner coils despite them having an oscillating voltage on their data legs.

we replaced a resistor that was the wrong resistance on the orange control board, but it didn't fix it. also, were seeing the second error light from the left coming on sometimes. it represents
