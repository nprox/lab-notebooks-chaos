Today, on Dr Zimmermans advice, we are going to try lots of different frequencyies from maybe 0.001 to 100 to see if the low pass filter is bypassed perhaps. Also, we're going to try to put together a new MCO with new parts and the latest v5 board diagrams.

I soldered together a new board but it didn't work right away. it kinda works with ground and positive shorted like before, but we want to avoid that shortcut.

In the meantime Nick worked on converting the schematic file to a layout that was oriented close to how the board actually is.

At the very end of class, i plugged it in to test and it didn't work until i shorted to ground and positive like I mentioned. This has been the only way to get chaotic motion so far.
