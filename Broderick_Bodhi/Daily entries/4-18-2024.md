Today I worked on our research paper outline and nick worked on modifying the data collection code to make the data points smaller, remove the outliers, and hopefully figure out why the angular velocity values are all very close to being integers rather than random doubles like we'd expect.

We think it's possible that since the angle values are integers and the time steps being taken are basically uniform that the angular velocity values would be integers also.

We also experimented with adding a color mapping to the data points to better visualize the progression of the points over time.
