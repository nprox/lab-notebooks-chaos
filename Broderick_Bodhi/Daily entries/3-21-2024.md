Today, we continued trying to figure out why the 2 mco's aren't oscillating and are stuck with their inner coils on. We removed and replaced the TL062 microcontroller on the red mco board and tried it on both the red mco and the orange mco, but no luck. we did discover some very odd jolting motion coming from the inner coil when we manually spun the rotor, but we aren't yet sure what that means. We have been probing everything we could think of with a multimeter to try to find where on the board the process is being derailed, but it is complicated and difficult to follow the path of the electricity. 

Update: when positive is shorted to ground for some reason, the mco is oscillating correctly but just with much less magnetic power than expected. We took out an oscilliscope to examine the behavior and thats were we left off for the day.
