Today nick and I discussed our plans for data collection using code to switch frequencies and amplitude automatically, bearing in mind that of the data to be useful, we need to adjust only one parameter at a time and do long trials. In the research paper, those people did frequency values from 0.1 to 0.94 in 0.06 rad/s increments. They found a transition from periodic to chaotic motion in between 0.76 and 0.82 rad/s. Their amplitude value is unknown but we'll probably just do 10 trials from 100 to 1000 for ours.

As much as we would like to collect data over spring break, it seems unlikely unless we are able to figure out the cause of the failure of the MCO today before 11:05. I'm trying to extract the compiled code from the MCO that was working and put it on the teensy board of the one that we never got working.

We did lots of testing with a multimeter, and we tried swapping control boards from one MCO to another, but to no avail. The power supplies are in the following orientation the last time the MCO was working: outer coil supply negative was shorted to ground, inner supply ground shorted to positive. seems weird but thats how it was setup.
