Today, I started by looking at the red mco again. I took the solder joints off the outer coil wires at both ends and their middle connection for testing and found that the coils only draw 2 volts at one amp compared to the orange mco which draws 6 volts at 1 amp. I think maybe the problem is that the coils are wound improperly?

I spent some time rearranging and simplifying our poster because it's due today.

One outer coil from the non working one is 1 ohm
two outer coils on the working one are 6 ohms

v=i*r
i=1amp

working:6v=1*r=6ohms
not working:2v=1*r -> r=2 ohms

the non working outer coils have 1/3 the resistance of the working coils, so that indicates they are possibly not wrapped tightly enough. 

I tried unwrapping one outer coil to count the number of turns but it is glued in and looks like it would be very difficult to un-glue.

Nick continued working on the code that he used to collect data over the weekend. He has data in amplitude increments of 50 and frequency increments of 0.1, and he intends to use the data plots to make videos of the evolution of the chaotic motion
